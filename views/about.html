    <h3>About the research</h3>

    <p>Questions were then formed around ‘trust’ online and how a user is likely to discern a trustworthy site, when so many legitimate websites employ techniques such as 'dark patterns'[1] to elicit their desired responses from users.</p>

    <p>The research aims to investigate the different ways in which users interact with a web based form, based on a number of different factors surrounding its design.</p>

    <h3>Hypothesis</h3>

    <p>A significant number of users will be convinced of the site’s ‘trustworthiness’ based purely on design and aesthetics.</p>

    <h3>Inspiration</h3>

    <p>Following the initial spark of an idea for this project, Lalita spoke with a number of industry and academic peers who inspired this work through their recommendations and knowledge of the subject.</p>

    <p>These recommendations included;</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Dan Ariely - Predictably Irrational.</li>
        <li>Harry Brignull - Dark Patterns.</li>
        <li>Chris Brogan &amp; Julien Smith - Trust Agents: Using the Web to Build Influence, Improve Reputation, and Earn Trust.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A full bibliography of texts is available <a href="/bibliography">here</a></p>

    <h3>Results</h3>

    <p>The project is due to conclude on 25th March 2012. Following submission of the dissertation and grading, the findings and results will be published on the site.</p>
